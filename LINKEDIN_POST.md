## Option 3: Story-Driven (for broader audience)

🌱 **From Idea to Exit: Building & Selling an AI Fitness Platform**

6 months ago, I saw a problem: fitness apps either give you generic templates or charge $100+/mo for personalization.

So I built GreenLean - an AI-powered platform that delivers custom meal plans and workout programs in 60 seconds, for the cost of a coffee.

**🛠️ What I Built:**
- Health quiz that collects 25+ data points (not just "lose weight" - considers health conditions, equipment, cooking skill, budget, lifestyle)
- OpenAI integration that generates truly personalized plans (not templates)
- Gamification system with challenges and streaks (because motivation matters)
- Admin dashboard (so gyms can use it for their members)
- Complete tracking (nutrition, workouts, water)

**💡 Cool Features You Might Miss:**
- Streak expiration emails (24h warning before you lose your streak)
- Shopping lists auto-generated from meal plans
- Workout plans adapt if you have injuries
- Dark mode (because it's 2025)
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Confetti when you complete challenges 🎉

**📊 Tech Stack:**
React 19, TypeScript, Supabase, FastAPI, OpenAI GPT-4, Vercel
(All the buzzwords, but they actually make sense together)

**🎯 Why I'm Selling:**
Not because it failed - it's production-ready and feature-complete.
I'm selling because I want to build something new, and this deserves an owner who'll take it to market.

**💰 The Opportunity:**
- Health & fitness apps = $14B market
- Growing 21% per year
- This is ready to launch (not MVP, not prototype - production-ready)
- Multiple revenue paths (B2C, B2B, corporate wellness)

**📈 Perfect For:**
- Someone who wants a SaaS business without building from scratch
- A gym owner who wants to offer app to members
- A health coach who wants to scale beyond 1-on-1
- An investor looking for health tech acquisition

**🚀 What You Get:**
- Complete codebase (frontend + AI service)
- 50+ features built & tested
- Admin dashboard for user management
- Database schema & all migrations
- My help for 30 days after sale

Available on SideProjectors now. DM for demo or questions.

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Build in public (this post is that)
2. Production-ready > "minimum viable" (quality matters)
3. Know when to move on (attached, but ready)

Who's ready to take this to $1M ARR? 🚀
